PROBLEM STATEMENT
The objective is to build a machine learning model for accurate employee salary prediction. Manual methods are subjective, leading to potential biases and inefficiencies in compensation. This project aims to use historical data to provide data-driven insights for fair salary benchmarking. It seeks to enable more informed and equitable compensation decisions, fostering a transparent work environment.

SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
This section defines the overall strategy and implementation methodology. Hardware requirements include a standard PC with sufficient RAM and processing power. Software includes Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, and key libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, and Joblib. These tools facilitate data manipulation, visualization, model training, and persistence.

ALGORITHM & DEPLOYMENT
The procedure starts with data collection and initial inspection. It involves preprocessing steps like handling missing values, outlier treatment, and feature filtering. Feature engineering creates new informative variables, followed by categorical data encoding. The data is then split into training and testing sets.

Various models, including Linear/Logistic Regression, KNN, and PCA, are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics. NLP techniques are applied using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer. The best-performing model is saved for future use, demonstrating a conceptual prediction deployment.

RESULT
Correlation analysis revealed strong positive relationships between salary, experience, and performance. K-Means clustering successfully segmented employees into distinct groups, providing insights into different profiles. Linear Regression achieved an R-squared of [Insert R2 score], while Logistic Regression showed an accuracy of [Insert accuracy score] for classification.

KNN models also demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for both regression and classification. PCA effectively reduced dimensionality while maintaining model performance. NLP models using CountVectorizer and TFIDF showed promising accuracies of [Insert CV Acc] and [Insert TFIDF Acc] respectively in salary classification.

CONCLUSION
This project successfully developed various machine learning models for employee salary prediction. It demonstrated the ability to predict both exact salary values and classifications with reasonable accuracy. Key insights included the strong influence of experience and performance, and the utility of engineered features. The project successfully tackled challenges like data cleaning and model parameter selection.

FUTURE SCOPE (Optional)
Future work could involve exploring advanced models like Random Forests or Neural Networks for improved accuracy. Deep Learning for NLP could enhance text feature representation. Implementing bias detection and mitigation techniques would ensure fairness. Developing an interactive dashboard and incorporating external economic data are also potential
